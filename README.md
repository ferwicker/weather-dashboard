## Motivation
Knowing the weather and checking forecasts is not only useful when you are planning to travel. As someone with friends and family scattered around the world, having easy access to the weather in their cities helps make me feel closer to them. Is my mum wearing a scarf today? I wonder if the mountains behind dad's house are snowy this morning. 

This weather dashboard presents basic weather information for any city in the world in a visually pleasant format and is easy to use.

## Process
As always, pencil (or pretty teal pen, in my case) comes before pixels (and code). The sketching stage for this project was simple, due to the brief being quite clear on structure. The Adobe XD design was quite faithful to the final product in this case, and I am very happy with how it turned out.
